 # 1936

 BYZ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Ended by the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, the Greco-Turkish War saw the rebirth of the state the West calls Byzantium. Its people, however, know their nation by another name. Romaion, the Roman land. Expansion after the war was stopped first by the League of Nations and then by the Great Depression.\n\nWith the League's power waning and the Depression's grip loosening, the Romaioi can look beyond their borders once more.  There are old scores to settle and an empire to restore."

 TUR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Turkey had a painful birth. Fighting a war against both the imperialist Europeans and scavenging Greeks at the same time. After years of fighting the Europeans were driven out of the Turkish homeland. However, the greeks managed to hold on to the western states.\n\nTurkey has spent over a decade preparing to reclaim these wealthy territories and the time to drive the Greeks back in to the Aegean Sea may have finally come."
 
 # 1939

 BYZ_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Byzantium has grown strong but the world is becoming more dangerous. Turkey remains a threat and Europe is on the brink of a second conflagration that may dwarf the first. While the part Byzantium will play is still unknown.\n\nChoose a side? Stand alone? Or even stand apart? If the Romaion do not make a choice soon it may be made for them."

 TUR_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Turkey has suffered, losing more territory to the hated Greeks. But Turkey is not finished yet. Europe being on the brink of war may bring new opportunities to finally get their revenge on the Greeks."

 TUR_submarine_1:0 "Birinci İnönü Class"
 TUR_submarine_1_desc:0 "The Birinci İnönü-class consisted of two coastal submarines built in the Netherlands for Turkey in the mid-1920s. They were the first ships built for the Turkish Navy after World War I. They displaced 520 tons and were armed with six 450mm torpedo tubes. They were somewhat slow but had good range."
 TUR_submarine_2:0 "Saldiray Class"
 TUR_submarine_2_desc:0 "The three submarines of the Saldiray class were launched in the late 1930s. Their design was heavily influenced by Germany, with the first ship of the class built in Germany, and the other two built under license in Istanbul. They were large ocean-going submarines, displacing over 930 tons and with excellent range. They were armed with six 533mm torpedo tubes."
 TUR_submarine_3:0 "Oruç Reis Class"
 TUR_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Oruç Reis-class submarines were built in Britain as a modified British S-class design. The ships were launched in 1940, with several temporarily interned by the Royal Navy. All but one were eventually returned to Turkey. The ships displaced 625 tons and were armed with five 533mm torpedo tubes. They were somewhat limited in their speed and range."
 TUR_submarine_4:0 "Sakarya Class"
 TUR_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Sakarya-class submarines were a series of U.S. Balao-class subs sold to Turkey after the war. They were very large submarines for their era, displacing over 1,520 tons. They had excellent range and speed, and were armed with ten 533mm torpedo tubes."

 TUR_destroyer_1:0 "Peyk Class"
 TUR_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Peyk-class consisted of a pair of large, fast torpedo boats commissioned for the Ottoman Navy in 1907. The ships were built in Germany and survived World War I, but were obsolete by World War II. The ships displaced 775 tons and were armed with twin 105mm/37 SK L/40 guns, as well as three 450mm torpedo tubes. They had decent range but were fairly slow for a destroyer."
 TUR_destroyer_2:0 "Kocatepe Class"
 TUR_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The two destroyers of the Kocatepe class were built in Italy for the Turkish Navy in 1931. They were based on the Italian folgore design. The ships displaced 1,250 tons and were armed with four 120mm/50 Ansaldo 1926 guns and six 533mm torpedo tubes. They had good speed and range as well."
 TUR_destroyer_3:0 "Demirhisar Class"
 TUR_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The four destroyers of the Demirhisar class were built in Britain and completed in 1942. Two of the ships were interned by the Royal Navy, one of which was returned after the war. The ships were based on the British I-class. They displaced 1,370 tons and had four 120mm/45 QF Mk IX guns as their main armament. They had decent speed and good range, and had a strong complement of AA guns and ASW equipment."

 TUR_light_cruiser_1:0 "Mecidiye Class"
 TUR_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Turkish ship Mecidiye was a protected cruiser built in the U.S. for the Ottoman Navy at the turn of the century. She was actually sunk in shallow water during World War II, but was raised and after a brief stint as part of the Imperial Russian Navy, was returned to Turkey. She displaced just under 3,500 tons and was armed with two 152mm/44 Bethlehem No. 2 and eight 120mm/45 Armstrong Y guns. They had decent range but were relatively slow and lightly armored."

 TUR_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Yavuz Class"
 TUR_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Yavuz was originally commissioned as the German battlecruiser Goeben but was sold to the Ottomans and recommissioned in 1914 to avoid internment. She displaced just under 23,000 tons and had decent speed and range. She was well-armored and was armed with ten 283mm/47 SK L/50 guns as well as a strong secondary armament."

 TUR_battleship_1:0 "Reşadiye Class"
 TUR_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Reşadiye class represents three dreadnought battleships ordered from the U.K. for the Turkish Navy just prior to World War I. Only one of the ships were completed, however, and it was subsequently interned by the British at the start of World War I. The ships would have displaced 23,000 tons and would have had good armor, speed, and range. Their main armament would have had ten 343mm/45 Vickers guns."
